**Goal of the homework**

In this homework, we built a system that provides users with information about roads in California and Nevada. Specifically, the implementation of the system consists of two parts. 

* __Backend:__ where we need developed algorithms that define the *functionalities of the system*
* __Frontend:__ where we provide *visualization for queries entered by the user*

 
 The repository contais:
 * ```functionality1.py```: A module that implements function for *Functionality 1- Find the Neighbours!*
 * ```functionality2.py```: A module that implements function for *Functionality 2- Find the martest Network!*
 * ```functionality3.py```: A module that implements function for *Functionality 3 - Shortest Ordered Route!*
 * ```main.py```: a Python script which executes the whole system. It ask some inputs and provide the right outputs.
 * ```functionality1+visualization1.ipynb```: A Notebook for a direct visualuzation of how Functionality 1  works and its visualization
